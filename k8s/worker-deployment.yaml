# NOTE: we should always provide our environment variables at string that's why we have wrapped the port number in ' '
# NO SERVICE AND PORT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO WORKER
# 1. Because no other object is going to access worker directly
# 2. and due to above reason we have not opened any port on worker object
# 3. We only create service when we want to have requests going into a set of pods
# 4. In our project, nothing is going to make an unprompted request to worker 
# 5. worker is going to connect to Redis
